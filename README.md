### Agile Development Tool

I utilized a GitHub project and a Kanban board. [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/eric-blake/projects/14)
As I start working on each issue I move it to the 'In progress' column.  When the coding for each issue has been completed, the issue is then moved to the 'done' column.


### User Stories

I used Github Issues to record the following user stories:

All User Stories include:
* Acceptance Criteria
* Tasks
* Labels (MoSCoW Priotarization)




### Structure & Logical Flow

The database model diagram was designed using Lucid Charts
